The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition.

For this task, create a Virtual Network (VNet) named devops-vnet and one subnet named devops-subnet within the VNet in the East US region. Make sure the IPv4 address range is 10.0.0.0/16.

Approach:
1. Go to portal.azure.com
2. Search for Virtual networks service and create one.
3. Give devops-vnet as name and East US as location.

4. Under IP address section, a default vnet address block and subnet block is created. Leave it as it is.
